Finding specific Indian case laws directly on point with the facts of Mr. Rajiv Sharma's case (challan under Section 185 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 for BAC of 42mg/100ml detected via breathalyzer at a routine checkpoint) requires access to a comprehensive legal database with detailed case summaries and judgments.  Publicly available online resources often lack this level of detail for specific cases.  Moreover, case law interpretation can vary depending on the specific facts and the jurisdiction (High Court or lower court).


Therefore, instead of providing specific case citations with summaries (which would require access to paid legal databases like Manupatra or SCC Online), I will provide a generalized approach to finding relevant case law and the types of arguments likely to be raised in a case like Mr. Sharma's.

**Approach to Finding Relevant Case Law:**

A lawyer representing Mr. Sharma would use legal databases to search for cases using keywords such as:

* "Section 185 Motor Vehicles Act"
* "Driving under influence of alcohol"
* "Breathalyzer test admissibility"
* "Blood alcohol content evidence"
* "Procedural irregularities traffic challan"
* "[Relevant State/High Court] Section 185 MVA" (Replacing "[Relevant State/High Court]" with the appropriate jurisdiction)


**Types of Arguments and Relevant Case Law Themes:**

While specific case citations are unavailable without access to paid legal databases, the following themes would be central to any defense:

1. **Admissibility of Breathalyzer Test Evidence:**  Cases would be sought that deal with challenges to the admissibility of breathalyzer test results.  This would include cases examining:
    * **Calibration and maintenance of the breathalyzer:**  Cases questioning the reliability of the device due to improper calibration or maintenance would be highly relevant.  The argument would focus on whether the test's accuracy was ensured according to established procedures.
    * **Procedural irregularities in administering the test:**  Cases addressing situations where the police did not follow proper procedure during the test (e.g., proper observation period, lack of witness, failure to provide the suspect with a copy of the test results) could be used to challenge the admissibility of the evidence.
    * **Chain of custody:**  The defense would need to investigate whether the chain of custody of the breathalyzer test results was maintained properly to ensure the integrity of the evidence.

2. **Reliability of the Breathalyzer Reading:**  Cases examining the accuracy and reliability of breathalyzer readings, especially those close to the legal limit, would be crucial. The defense might argue that the reading was inaccurate or affected by factors such as the individual's metabolism, recent consumption of food or drink, or the machine's error margin.

3. **Procedural Fairness:**  Cases concerning procedural fairness in issuing traffic challans under Section 185 would be relevant.  Arguments could be made about:
    * **Failure to provide proper notice or opportunity to respond:**  The defense might argue that Mr. Sharma was not provided with sufficient information about the charges or an opportunity to address the allegations.
    * **Lack of due process:**  Cases emphasizing the right to legal representation and a fair hearing would be relevant.


4. **Burden of Proof:** The defense would rely on precedents establishing that the prosecution bears the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Sharma was driving under the influence and that the test result accurately reflects his condition at the time of driving.


**Disclaimer:** This response provides a general framework.  A complete legal analysis requires access to detailed case law from the relevant jurisdiction, specifics of the breathalyzer test, and details of the police procedure.  Mr. Sharma should consult a legal professional for specific advice.
