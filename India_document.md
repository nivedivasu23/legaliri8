**Date:** October 26, 2023

**To:** The Traffic Police, New Delhi

**From:** [Law Firm Letterhead/Legal Representative's Contact Information]

**Subject: Legal Representation for Mr. Rajiv Sharma - Challan No. [Insert Challan Number]**

This firm represents Mr. Rajiv Sharma in response to the traffic challan issued to him on March 15, 2023, under Section 185 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (hereinafter "MVA"), for allegedly driving under the influence of alcohol.  The challan cites a blood alcohol content (BAC) of 42 mg/100ml, exceeding the prescribed limit of 30 mg/100ml, as determined by a breathalyzer test administered at a routine traffic checkpoint in New Delhi at approximately 10:30 PM.

We are writing to formally request the following information to thoroughly assess the legality and validity of the challan:

1. **Detailed Report of Breathalyzer Test:**  We require a complete report detailing the specifics of the breathalyzer test administered to Mr. Sharma. This must include:
    * The make, model, and serial number of the breathalyzer device used.
    * Calibration records and certificates demonstrating the device's accuracy and proper maintenance prior to and after the test.
    * A step-by-step account of the testing procedure followed, including the time elapsed between the alleged offense and the administration of the test.
    * Confirmation of proper observation periods before testing to ensure no interfering substances were consumed.
    * The identity of the police officer(s) who administered the test and any witnesses present.
    * A certified copy of the test results, including any supporting documentation.
    * Confirmation that Mr. Sharma was informed of his rights before the test and that the test was conducted in accordance with the established procedures under the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989, specifically rules pertaining to breathalyzer testing under Section 185 of the MVA.


2. **Police Procedural Details:**  We request a complete account of the events leading to the issuance of the challan, including:
    * The exact time and location of the traffic stop.
    * The reason for the traffic stop.
    * The sequence of events leading to the administration of the breathalyzer test.
    * Any observations made by the police officer(s) regarding Mr. Sharma's behavior and condition.
    * Any video or photographic evidence recorded at the time of the incident.


3. **Relevant Legal Documentation:** We request copies of all relevant documentation pertaining to the challan, including:
    * A complete copy of the challan itself.
    * Any supporting documents cited in the challan.
    * Evidence of the proper chain of custody for all evidence collected.


**Legal Arguments for Consideration:**

Our preliminary assessment suggests several potential legal arguments for challenging the challan, contingent upon the information received:

* **Challenging Admissibility of Breathalyzer Evidence:** We will assess the procedures employed for the breathalyzer test to ensure compliance with the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989.  Any deviations from established protocols or deficiencies in the chain of custody will be grounds to challenge the admissibility of the test results.

* **Challenging Accuracy of BAC Reading:** The proximity of the BAC reading (42 mg/100ml) to the legal limit (30 mg/100ml) warrants a thorough review of the test's accuracy, considering factors such as the device's margin of error, potential influencing factors, and the methodology of the test itself.

* **Procedural Irregularities:** We will scrutinize the entire process leading to the issuance of the challan for any procedural irregularities that may have infringed upon Mr. Sharma's rights.


**Next Steps:**

Upon receiving the requested documentation, we will conduct a thorough legal analysis of the case. We will then advise Mr. Sharma on the appropriate course of action, which may include negotiating a resolution, filing an appeal, or pursuing other legal remedies.

We expect a response to this request within [Number] days.  Failure to provide the requested information within this timeframe may lead to further legal action.

Sincerely,
